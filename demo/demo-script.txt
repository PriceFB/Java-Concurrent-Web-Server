Demo Video Script
=================

1. **Introduction (15s)**
   - State project name, course, and objective (build a concurrent web server).

2. **Server Startup (30s)**
   - Show terminal command: java -cp out edu.fiu.cop6727.webserver.HttpServer --port 8080 --docRoot wwwroot --threads 8.
   - Highlight configuration (port, doc root, thread count) and explain listener + worker model.

3. **Static Content Demo (20s)**
   - Open http://localhost:8080/ in the browser to show the homepage and CSS styling.
   - Briefly mention static file serving and MIME type detection.

4. **Echo Endpoint (30s)**
   - Navigate to /echo.html, submit sample payload, and show server response + console log entry.
   - Mention POST parsing and body handling.

5. **Concurrency Highlight (60s)**
   - Run two curl http://localhost:8080/slow commands simultaneously (or use PowerShell background jobs).
   - Keep terminal with server logs visible to show separate thread names handling each request concurrently.
   - Point out that both requests finish after ~3 seconds, not sequentially.

6. **Health Endpoint + Shutdown (15s)**
   - Call /health to show quick readiness response.
   - Stop the server with Ctrl+C and mention graceful shutdown of thread pool.

7. **Source Code Walkthrough (90s)**
   - Show HttpServer.java (listener + thread pool) and ClientHandler.java (per-connection parsing).
   - Highlight RequestRouter logic for /slow and /echo, tying it back to concurrency concepts in DBMS worker pools.

8. **Wrap-Up (15s)**
   - Summarize test strategy and mention that written reports describe the architecture, implementation, and testing evidence.

Total runtime: ~4 minutes.
